# MCM results
> For now this is a straight copy of the README, will update later

The resulting `mcmresultclass` object contains your estimates and standard erros by default, as well as the final optimizer loss, loss history, and a copy of the model object that was used to generate the results.
Even though running `print(my_result)` produces output that looks like a dataframe, the object itself is not. If you want to continue working with your parameter and SE estimates, or write them to a file, you have to convert it to a dataframe first.
```
my_result_df <- as.data.frame(my_result)
```
