# Editing an MCM model
> For now this is a straight copy of the README, will update later

You can edit several things about the model, such as freeing parameters, fixing parameters or starting values. Always use MCMedit for this purpose, **do not** edit the matrices by hand, as MCMedit parses your changes and ensures everything in the MCMmodel is changed accordingly. Below are some examples of what you may want to change.

In matrix A; separate a1 and a2, in the simplest case with two input variables this would be the same as setting `constrained_a` to `FALSE` in `MCMmodel`.
```
my_model <- MCMedit(my_model, "A", "a1", c("a1", "a2"))
```
In matrix Fm; freely estimate f1 variance, i.e. make it a parameter rather than a fixed value. Note the `c(1, 2)` in this function call refers to the coordinates of this parameter in the Fm matrix.
```
my_model <- MCMedit(my_model, "Fm", c(1, 2), "fm1")
```
Constrain b1_1 to zero
```
my_model <- MCMedit(my_model, "A", "b1_1", 0)
```

Change the starting value of b2 to 0.8
```
my_model <- MCMedit(my_model, "start", "b2", 0.8)
```
Set the starting value of all a parameters to 0.5
```
my_model <- MCMedit(my_model, "start", "a", 0.5)
```
Change the upper bound of a1 to 2
```
mcmmodel <- MCMedit(mcmmodel, "ubound", "a1", 2)
```
Set lower and upper bounds of a1 to c(-1, 1)
```
mcmmodel <- MCMedit(mcmmodel, "bound", "a1", c(-1, 1))
```
Set lower and upper bounds of all b parameters to -1, 1
```
mcmmodel <- MCMedit(mcmmodel, "bound", "b", c(-1, 1))
```
Set upper bound of all k parameters to 200
```
mcmmodel <- MCMedit(mcmmodel, "ubound", "k", 200)
```
Check the current bounds
```
mcmmodel$bounds
```
> **__NOTE__**: If you are using bounds, ensure `use_bounds` is set to TRUE in `MCMfit`
