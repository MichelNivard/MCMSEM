# Editing an MCM model
We try to cover major model changes in the `MCMmodel()` function, but we cannot possibly account for all possible models you might want to run using MCMSEM. 
Therefore we have included the `MCMedit()` function to allow you to make detailed changes to an MCM model.

The general syntax of `MCMedit()` is the following: `adjusted_model <- MCMedit(base_model, pointer, name, value)` where:
 - `base_model` is the base model to be changed
 - `pointer` points to the location of values need to be changed, i.e. one of the matrices (A, Fm, S, Sk, or K), bounds, or starts
 - `name` represents the name or coordinate(s) of values to be changed
 - `value` the new value, this can be a new name (to create a new free parameter), a fixed value, or 0 (to disable a parameter for example)

This will return the edited model `adjusted model`, which is another MCM model object with the edits applied.

For the purposes of this wiki we will start with the following base model:
``` 
my_model <- MCMmodel(data_summary, n_latent=2, scale_data=FALSE)
```

## Dropping parameters
Our aim for this section is to:
 - Drop the paths from `f1` to `x4` and `x5`
 - Drop the paths from `f2` to `x4` and `x5`
 - Drop the causal paths from `x1` to `x5` (both ways)

So our goal for this section is to end up with the following model:

![Figure 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zenabtamimy/MCMSEM/dev-torch/imgs/2.2.Figure2.svg)

There are a number of ways to do this.

### By coordinates
First parameters can be dropped based on their coordinates in their respective matrix. All a (factorloadings) and b (causal path) parameters reside in the `A` matrix. 
In order to change parameters by their coordinates we will first need to know their position in the matrix. Therefore we will start by displaying the `A` matrix:
```
print(my_model, matrix="A")
```

Which prints the following:
```
     [,1] [,2] [,3]   [,4]   [,5]   [,6]   [,7]  
[1,] "0"  "0"  "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"   
[2,] "0"  "0"  "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"   
[3,] "a1" "0" "0"    "b2_1" "b3_1" "b4_1" "b5_1"
[4,] "a1" "a2" "b1_2" "0"    "b3_2" "b4_2" "b5_2"
[5,] "a1" "a2" "b1_3" "b2_3" "0"    "b4_3" "b5_3"
[6,] "a1" "a2" "b1_4" "b2_4" "b3_4" "0"    "b5_4"
[7,] "a1" "a2" "b1_5" "b2_5" "b3_5" "b4_5" "0"   
```

From this matrix we can observe that `a1` paths we want to drop are located at `[6, 1]` (path `f1 -> x4`) and `[7, 1]` (path `f1 -> x5`).
Dropping a parameter is done by setting its value to 0. So by running the followig
``` 
my_model2 <- MCMedit(my_model,         # The base model
                     pointer = "A",    # We are changing values in the A matrix
                     name = c(6, 1),   # We want to change the values at coordinate [6, 1]
                     value = 0)        # We want to set that value to 0 (i.e. remove the parameter)
    
my_model2 <- MCMedit(my_model2, pointer="A", name=c(7, 1), value=0) # Same for [7, 1]
```

There are more `a2` paths we need to drop, namely those located at `[3, 2]` (path `f2 -> x1`), `[4, 2]` (path `f2 -> x2`) and `[5, 2]` (path `f2 -> x3`).
This can be done in a similar fashion, but you can also provide multiple coordinates at once by using a 2-element list with x-coordinates, and y-coordinates:
``` 
coords <- list( c(3, 4, 5),
                c(2, 2, 2) )
my_model2 <- MCMedit(my_model, pointer="A", name=coords, value=0)
```

Turning your model into a uni-directional model, for instance, is likely also easiest via coordinates, for example, let's say we want to drop all `b` parameters in the upper diagonal (i.e. all "reverse" causal paths):

``` 
nvars <- 5
n_latent <- 2
coords <- expand.grid(x=1:nvars+n_latent, y=1:nvars+n_latent)[upper.tri(matrix(0, nvars, nvars), diag=FALSE), ]
my_model2 <- MCMedit(my_model, pointer="A", name=list(coords$x, coords$y), value=0)
```
To verify our edits worked we can run `print(my_model2, matrix="A")` again, which will now return the following:

``` 
     [,1] [,2] [,3]   [,4]   [,5]   [,6]   [,7]
[1,] "0"  "0"  "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"    "0" 
[2,] "0"  "0"  "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"    "0" 
[3,] "a1" "0"  "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"    "0" 
[4,] "a1" "a2" "b1_2" "0"    "0"    "0"    "0" 
[5,] "a1" "a2" "b1_3" "b2_3" "0"    "0"    "0" 
[6,] "a1" "a2" "b1_4" "b2_4" "b3_4" "0"    "0" 
[7,] "a1" "a2" "b1_5" "b2_5" "b3_5" "b4_5" "0" 
```

### By name
Lastly, parameters can be dropped using their name. We will use this method to drop path `x1 -> x5` and `x5 -> x1`, which are labelled `b1_5` and `b5_1` respectively.
```
my_model2 <- MCMedit(my_model, pointer="A", name=c("b1_5", "b5_1"), value=0)
```

To verify our edits worked we can run `print(my_model2, matrix="A")` again, which will now return the following:
``` 
     [,1] [,2] [,3]   [,4]   [,5]   [,6]   [,7]  
[1,] "0"  "0"  "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"   
[2,] "0"  "0"  "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"   
[3,] "a1" "0"  "0"    "b2_1" "b3_1" "b4_1" "0"  
[4,] "a1" "a2" "b1_2" "0"    "b3_2" "b4_2" "b5_2"
[5,] "a1" "a2" "b1_3" "b2_3" "0"    "b4_3" "b5_3"
[6,] "a1" "a2" "b1_4" "b2_4" "b3_4" "0"    "b5_4"
[7,] "a1" "a2" "0"    "b2_5" "b3_5" "b4_5" "0"   
```
Confirming our edits are properly applied

## Splitting parameters
In this section we will continue from the previous section we will do the following:
 - Split the `a1` parameter into `a1_1`, `a1_2` and `a1_3` so the paths from `f1` to `x1`, `x2` and `x3` are free.
 - Split the `a2` parameter into `a2_4` and `a2_5` so the paths from `f2` to `x4` and `x5` are free.

So our goal for this section is to end up with the following model:

![Figure 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zenabtamimy/MCMSEM/dev-torch/imgs/2.2.Figure3.svg)

> **Note**: Splitting of factor loadings is typically more efficiently achieved by adding `contrained_a=FALSE` to `MCMmodel()`. However, for the purposes of this demonstration we will do it manually.

### By coordinate
This works similar to dropping parameters, only now instead of providing the value 0, we provide the new parameter names.
Looking at our A matrix again `print(my_model, matrix="A")`
``` 
     [,1] [,2] [,3]   [,4]   [,5]   [,6]   [,7]  
[1,] "0"  "0"  "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"   
[2,] "0"  "0"  "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"   
[3,] "a1" "0"  "0"    "b2_1" "b3_1" "b4_1" "0"  
[4,] "a1" "a2"  "b1_2" "0"    "b3_2" "b4_2" "b5_2"
[5,] "a1" "a2"  "b1_3" "b2_3" "0"    "b4_3" "b5_3"
[6,] "a1" "a2" "b1_4" "b2_4" "b3_4" "0"    "b5_4"
[7,] "a1" "a2" "0"    "b2_5" "b3_5" "b4_5" "0"
```
We can see that the coordinates of `a1` are `[3,1]`, `[4,1]` and `[5,1]`. So using similar semantics as previously described:
``` 
coords <- list( c(3, 4, 5),  c(2, 2, 2) )  # We start by making each factor load on 1 variable again
my_model_split_A <- MCMedit(my_model, pointer="A", name=coords, value=0)

coords <- list( c(3, 4, 5),
                c(1, 1, 1) )
new_names <- c("a1_1", "a1_2", "a1_3")
my_model_split_A <- MCMedit(my_model_split_A, pointer="A", name=coords, value=new_names)
```

### By name
Typically splitting your parameter by its name is the easier solution. Remember we have already dropped 3 of the 5 paths of `a2` previously, so two paths remain (those to `x4` and `x5`). Thus we will have to provide two new parameter names in this case.
``` 
new_names <- c("a2_4", "a2_5")
my_model_split_A <- MCMedit(my_model_split_A, pointer="A", name="a2", value=new_names)
```

Again we can verify these changes worked by running `print(my_model_split_A, matrix="A")`
``` 
     [,1]   [,2]   [,3]   [,4]   [,5]   [,6]   [,7]  
[1,] "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"   
[2,] "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"    "0"   
[3,] "a1_1" "0"    "0"    "b2_1" "b3_1" "b4_1" "0"   
[4,] "a1_2" "0"    "b1_2" "0"    "b3_2" "b4_2" "b5_2"
[5,] "a1_3" "0"    "b1_3" "b2_3" "0"    "b4_3" "b5_3"
[6,] "0"    "a2_4" "b1_4" "b2_4" "b3_4" "0"    "b5_4"
[7,] "0"    "a2_5" "0"    "b2_5" "b3_5" "b4_5" "0" 
```

## Constraining parameters
Currently, constraining parameters can only be done via coordinates. For example, to undo our previous change and contrain `a2_4` and `a2_5` to the same parameter, we can do the following:
``` 
my_model_single_a2 <- MCMedit(my_model_split_A, pointer="A", name=list(c(6, 7), c(2, 2)), value="a2")
```
Note this result is stored in a different model as the rest of this wiki will assume `a2_4` and `a2_5` are still separate paths.

## Adding new parameters
Adding new parameters works the same as dropping parameters, but can only be done via coordinates (as there is no old name to replace).

In this example we will undo our previous change and reinstate the paths `x1 -> x5` and `x5 -> x1`:
``` 
my_model <- MCMedit(my_model, pointer="A", name=list(c(7, 3), c(3, 7)), value=c("b1_5", "b5_1"))
```

## Changing start values
To see the current starting values per parameter, see
``` 
my_model$start_values
```

Changing starting values can only be done by name (as the starting values are bound to the parameters themselves, not the matrices).
You can change starting values by providing the pointer `"start"`, and providing either the name of a single parameter, or a vector with parameter names to set multiple start values to the same value simultaneously:
```
my_model <- MCMedit(my_model, pointer="start", name="a2_4", value=0.1)  # Set a2_4 to 0.1
my_model <- MCMedit(my_model, pointer="start", name="a2_5", value=0.1)  # Set a2_4 to 0.1 
my_model <- MCMedit(my_model, pointer="start", name=c("a1_1", "a1_2", "a1_3"), value=0.1)  # Set a1_1, a1_2 a1_3 start values to 0.1
```

We recognized that this can become messy in larger models, therefore we have also implemented a way to change the starting values of all parameters of a certain type in one go.
So a more efficient way of applying the previous change (since it encompassess all `a` parameters) would be:
```
my_model <- MCMedit(my_model, pointer="start", name="a", value=0.1)
```

In some cases you may want to set all starting values simultaneously, in which case you can run the following:
``` 
my_model <- MCMedit(my_model, pointer="start", name="all", value=0)
```

Note: Starting values cannot be changed using `my_model$start_values["start", "a1"] <- .5`

## Changing bounds

> **Note**: If you are using bounds, ensure `use_bounds` is set to TRUE in `MCMfit`

To see the current bounds per parameter, see
``` 
my_model$bounds
```

### Upper and lower bound
To change the upper and lower bound of a single parameter, use the pointer `bound`:
``` 
my_model <- MCMedit(my_model, pointer="bound", name="a1_1", value=c(-1, 1))
```

Alternatively you can change bounds for multiple parameters by supplying a vector of parameter names
For example, let's set the bounds of `a1_1`, `a1_2` and `a1_3` to `[-1, 1]`
``` 
my_model <- MCMedit(my_model, pointer="bound", name=c("a1_1", "a1_2", "a1_3"), value=c(-1, 1))
```

Changing bounds of a whole group of parameters works the same as starting values, e.g. to change the bounds of all `a` parameters to [-1, 1]:
``` 
my_model <- MCMedit(my_model, pointer="bound", name="a", value=c(-1, 1))
```

### Upper or lower bounds separately
You can change the lower and upper bounds separately by using the pointers `lbound` and `ubound` respectively.
 
## Changes in other matrices
Throughout this wiki we have only made changes to the `A` matrix as it is likely to be your first target for making changes to your model.
Changes to other matrices work the exact same way as changes to the `A` matrix as outlined above, with a few caveats for the `Sk` and `K` matrices:
 - Adding parameters to the `Sk` or `K` matrix is tricky as they are 2D representations of 3D and 4D matrices, so interpreting what the coordinates mean, and which cell is which co-kurtosis is not trivial. It is therefore not recommended to change these yourself.
 - Starting values for `sk` and `k` are determined algorithmically (from the skew and kurtosis of the observed data), which is very likely to be the best starting value. It is therefore not recommended to change these unless you absolutely have to (for example if you want to compare fit performance of 2 models at the exact same starting point).
