# Fitting an MCM model
> For now this is a straight copy of the README, will update later

Now that you have applied the changes you want you can fit the model. You will have the pass your data to the `MCMfit` function again, we could store your data in the MCMmodel object, but that would result in unnecessary copies of potentially large datasets (not ideal).
```
my_result <- MCMfit(my_model, data)
```

By default, SEs are computed asymptotically, you can also compute the SEs through bootstrapping if you wish. Be warend, however, as this will take considerably longer.
``` 
my_result <- MCMfit(my_model, data, se_type='two-step', bootstrap_iter=100, bootstrap_chunks=1000)
```

If you are unsure the optimization is good enough, and wonder if a minimum is found, you can track the loss progress either by checking `my_result$history$loss` after the model completed, or by running
``` 
my_result <- MCMfit(my_model, data, silent=FALSE)
```

If needed you can change the number of iterations, and/or the optimizers learning rate. Note that two different optimizers are used sequentially. First RPROP, then LBFGS. Only the learning rate of RPROP can be changed.
``` 
my_result <- MCMfit(my_model, data, optim_iters=c(100, 12), learning_rate=0.03)
```

In large models using both skewness and kurtosis for parameter estimation may not be required, and disabling either of these can significantly improve performance. Note that this is still relatively untested though.
``` 
my_result_no_skew <- MCMfit(my_model, data, use_skewness=FALSE)
my_result_no_kurt <- MCMfit(my_model, data, use_kurtosis=FALSE)
```
