# Generate test data

## Simulate data

To allow users to easily test for expected performance and settings, the `MCMSEM` package includes a function to simulate data.
The default is a simple test dataset of two variables with one latent factor (the same as used in the publication).

```
simulated_data <- simulate_data()
```

Note that, since the function is intended to be used for `MCMSEM`, by default `simulate_data()` will return an `MCMdatasummary` object. To obtain the raw data as a dataframe include the argument `asdataframe=TRUE`.

If you want to design your own dataset with more variables, you will need to provide the following:
 - `a`: A matrix of latent factor loadings per factor, per variable (each row represents a variable, each column represents a factor)
 - `b`: A matrix of the causal parameters, with 1.0 on the diagonal (each row represents a variable, each column represents a variable)
 - `shape`: Shapes to use for generating skewness (`0` for no skewness), this is passed to `stats::rgamma`
 - `df`: Shapes to use for generating kurtosis (`0` for no kurtosis), this is passed to `stats::rt`

You can also optionally change the sample size from its default 500000 using `n`.
