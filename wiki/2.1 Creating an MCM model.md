# Creating an MCM model

## The default model
The first step to using MCMSEM is to generate a model object. This object stores all the required matrices and settings for you. 
``` 
my_model <- MCMmodel(dataset)
```

By default, this will create the model below.

![Figure 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zenabtamimy/MCMSEM/dev-torch/imgs/2.1.Figure1.svg)

This default model includes the following:
 - Variances, skewness and kurtosis for observed variables (not shown in the figure to prevent crowding it even more).
 - One latent factor (`f1`)
 - One free pramater (`a1`) for each of the paths from the latent factor to the observed variables
 - All causal paths between the observed traits, where `bx_y` represents the causal path from variable `x` to variable `y`. Note not all labels are included in the figure.

> **Tip**: You can always obtain a similar visualization of your own model by running `plot(my_model)`

## Multiple factor models
We imagine that in many cases the default model will not be the exact model you want to run. You will likely want to change a number of things. For example, the number of latent factors. 
To do this, use the `n_latent` argument in `MCMmodel`:
``` 
my_model <- MCMmodel(dataset, n_latent=2)
```

This will create the following model.

![Figure 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zenabtamimy/MCMSEM/dev-torch/imgs/2.1.Figure2.svg)
 
This model includes two latent factors (`f1` and `f2`) with two free parameters,`a1` and `a2`, for all paths from `f1` and all paths from `f2` respectively to all the observed variables.
Apart from that, the model is identical to the default model.

> **Note**: Almost everything about the model can be changed through `MCMedit` (See section 2.2 Editing an MCM model), but the number of latent factors is the exception. This is fixed once the model is generated. 

## Free factor loading
By seting `constrained_a` to `FALSE` one parameter is fitted for each latent factor for each variable (so a total of `n_latent`*`n_variables` free parameters.
```
my_model <- MCMmodel(dataset, constrained_a=FALSE)
```

This will create the following model.

![Figure 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zenabtamimy/MCMSEM/dev-torch/imgs/2.1.Figure3.svg)
 
Note that this model contains 5 (i.e. the number of observed variables) free parameters instead of 1 (`a1` in the default model): `ax_y` where x is the factor number and y is the observed variable number.

> **Tip**: You can combine `n_latent` and `constrained_a` to your hearts content. But keep in mind that the number of parameters quickly balloons in larger models when doing this.

## Latent causal paths
In some cases you might be more interested in the relationship between latent factors than in the relationship between observed variables.
In that case you might want to estimate the causal paths between the latent factors as opposed to those between the observed variables. To do this use `causal_latent` and `causal_observed`
```
my_model <- MCMmodel(dataset, n_latent=2, causal_latent=TRUE, causal_observed=FALSE)
```

This will create the following model.

![Figure 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zenabtamimy/MCMSEM/dev-torch/imgs/2.1.Figure4.svg)

In this model causal paths between the observed traits are no longer estimated, and instead parameters `blx_y` are included which represent the causal path of factor `x` on factor `y`.

> **Tip**: The arguments `var_latent`, `var_observed`, `skew_latent`, `skew_observed`, `kurt_latent`, `kurt_latent` work similarly for variance, skewness and kurtosis respectively. Consider using a combination of them to obtain the best model.

## Scaling data

By default `MCMmodel` will scale your data. If you know your data is already scaled (as in the case of our example), or have already scaled your data previously you can set `scale_data` to `FALSE`.

``` 
my_model <- MCMmodel(dataset, n_latent=2, scale_data=FALSE)
```

> **Note**: This option can also be used to run MCMSEM on unscaled data, but as of now this is still untested so use at your own discretion.
 
## Naming latent factors

By default `MCMmodel` will obtain observed variable names from the input matrix or dataframe. Default latent factor names are `f1`, `f2`, ..., `fn`, but these can be changed to custom names. 
Note this option changes nothing about the model itself, it just replaces the names of the latent factors in figures and tables by those provided to the `latent_names` argument. For example:
``` 
my_model <- MCMmodel(dataset, n_latent=2, latent_names=c("positive_affect", "negative_affect"))
```

## Visualizing your model

At any point you can make a qgrpah of your MCM model to see a visual representation of the paths to be estimated by running 
```
plot(my_model)
```

## Advanced
> :warning: __WARNING__: The following information is intended for very advanced users only. Changes to your MCM model should always be performed through `MCMedit` (see 2.2 Editing an MCM model), and we do not recommend changing the higher order co-moment matrices by hand unless absolutely necessary.

### The MCM model object

The MCM model object is an R6 object of class `mcmmodelclass`, meaning objects within it are modified in place. If you ever want to make changes to your model without MCMedit (again, this is not recommended), it is recomended to do so in a hardcopy of the model object: `modelcopy <- my_model$copy()`
The MCM model object contains the following objects:
 - `named_matrices`: List of A, Fm, S, Sk and K matrices of type `character` detailing the position of free parameters in the matrices
 - `num_matrices`: List of A, Fm, S, Sk, and K matrices of type `numeric`. At model inception these matrices will hold only starting values, after `MCMfit` these will hold the actual estimates.
 - `param_names`: Vector of type `character` containing names of all free parameters
 - `param_values`: Vector of type `numeric` containing numeric values of the free parameters
 - `param_coords`: List of length `n_parameters`. Each element in this details the following for each of the parameters (1) source matrix name, (2): 1D-coordinates, (3): multiplier (allowing for e.g. `-a1` to be used)
 - `start_values`: Dataframe with 1 row and `n_parameters` columns containing starting values for each parameter
 - `bounds`: Dataframe with 2 rows (`L` and `U`) and `n_parameters` columns containing lower and upper bounds respectively for each free parameter
 - `meta_data`: Model meta data, list containing the following:
   - `n_obs`: nrow(data)
   - `n_phenotypes`: N observed phenotypes
   - `n_latent`: N latent factors
   - `bound_defaults`: Default values for bounds
   - `data_was_scaled`: TRUE if the input data was already scaled, otherwise FALSE
   - `scale_data`: TRUE if data should be scaled, otherwise FALSE
   - `original_colnames`: Original column names of the input data (for table and plot purposes)
   - `latent_names`: Automatically generated or user input latent factor names (for table and plot purposes) 

The MCM model object contains the following methods:
 - `copy`: Returns a deep copy of the `mcmmodelclass` object
 - `initialize`: Initializes a new `mcmmodelclass` instance
 - `show`: Returns the default visualization of the `mcmmodelclass` object (the A, Fm and S matrices), executed upon `my_model` and `print(my_model)`
 - `parse`: Parse changes made to the model via `MCMedit`: Updates the underlying structure (start values, bounds, param_coords, etc) depending on changes made.

### Higher co-moment matrices 

The higher order co-moment matrices `M3`: (co-)skewness matrix and `M4`: (co-)kurtosis are 2D representations of 3D and 4D matrices respectively, the layouts of these matrices are as follows, where  `xaxbxc` represents the co-skewnes between variables xa, xb, and xc and `xaxbxcxd` represents the co-kurtosis between variables xa, xb, xc and xd.

```

To obtain the 2-D coords of an N-D matrix you can use the following function:

``` 
nd_to_2d_idx <- function(nrows, x, y, ...) {
  # nrow must be provided as that determines stepsizes
  # x: first dim idx (i.e. row); y = second dim idx (i.e. col), ... = additional dim(s) idx(s)
  dim_idx <- list(...)
  for (i in seq_along(dim_idx)) {
    y <- y + (nrows^(i))*(dim_idx[[i]]-1)
  }
  return(list(x=x, y=y))
}
```

So in our 4-parameter example, to obtain the indices of the co-skwenss of variables 1, 2 and 3 and the co-kurtosis of variables 2, 2, 4 and 4:
``` 
n_pars <- 4
coskew123_index  <- nd_to_2d_idx(n_pars, 1, 2, 3)
print(coskew123_index)
cokurt2244_index <- nd_to_2d_idx(n_pars, 2, 2, 4, 4)
print(cokurt2244_index)
```

The reverse is achieved by the following function:
``` 
twod_to_nd_idx <- function(nrows, x, y, ndims) {
  if (ndims < 2) stop("ndims should be >= 2")
  nd_coords <- list()
  nd_coords[[1]] <- x
  for (i in ndims:2) {
    nd_coords[[i]] <- floor((y - 1) / nrows^(i-2)) + 1
    y <- ((y - 1) %% nrows^(i-2)) + 1
  }
  return(nd_coords)
}
```

Such that:

``` 
n_pars <- 4

coskew123_index  <- nd_to_2d_idx(n_pars, 1, 2, 3)
print(twod_to_nd_idx(n_pars, coskew123_index$x, coskew123_index$y, ndims=3))
> Returns list of 1, 2, 3 

cokurt2244_index <- nd_to_2d_idx(n_pars, 2, 2, 4, 4)
print(twod_to_nd_idx(n_pars, cokurt2244_index$x, cokurt2244_index$y, ndims=4))
> Returns list of 2, 2, 4, 4
```
