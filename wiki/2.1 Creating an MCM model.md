# Creating an MCM model
> For now this is a straight copy of the README, will update later

Next create an MCMmodel from your data
``` 
my_model <- MCMmodel(data)
```

By default, this will create model with one latent confounder, and constrained loadings of this confounder on your variables (i.e. 1 parameter for confounding). You can change this using the appropriate arguments.
``` 
my_extensive_model <- MCMmodel(data, n_confounding=2, constrained_a=FALSE)
```

By seting `constrained_a` to `FALSE` one parameter is fitted for each latent confounder for each variable (so n_confounding*n_variables confounders).

This model object contains the underlying matrices, parameter names and parameter values of the MCMSEM model, as well as some metadata. You can see the layout of the parameter matrices by running
```
print(my_model)
```
