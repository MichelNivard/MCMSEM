# MCM data

## MCM data summary

MCMSEM does not use all raw data for optimization, only the co-moment matrices, and some meta-data. Therefore, we have designed an `MCMdatasummary` object, which holds only the data necessary to run MCMSEM. 
This can have a number of benefits depending on your situation:
 1. It allows you to free up memory by removing the raw data after generating a summary object
 2. It allows for pre-computation of some parts if you want to fit (or just test) multiple different models on the same data
 3. It allows different research groups to more easily share data. The only data contained in the summary object are co-moment matrices, and (optionally) a covariance matrix of the moment (`S.m`) for computation of asymptotic standard errors. Hence there shouldn't be any privacy concerns given the source data is large enough (which it should be to even properly use MCMSEM).

To create an `MCMdatasummary`, use the `MCMdatasummary()` function, for example:
``` 
data <- read.csv("mydata.csv")
mcmsemsummary <- MCMdatasummary(data)
```

### Limiting options

By default, both `use_skewness` and `use_kurtosis` are enabled, as this allows for the most flexibility in `MCMfit()`. If you intend to only fit models without skewness or kurtosis (see wiki `3 Fitting an MCM model` ) you can also disable them here.
A data summary object generated with both these options enabled will still be able to run an `MCMfit()` call with `use_skewness` and `use_kurtosis` set to `FALSE`.
Note however that the other way around is not possible, i.e. a data summary generated with `use_skewness` and/or `use_kurtosis` set to `FALSE` will **never** be able to run any different model. Therefore, when exporting data, especially to a different research group, we highly recommend leaving these enabled to prevent having to recreate a summary object when you decide to switch to a different model type.
When disabled, these arguments will prevent the co-skewness and co-kurtosis matrices from being generated, and will prevent these moments from being computed in `S.m`

Similarly, `prep_asymptotic_se` is enabled by default. When enabled this argument will pre-compute the `S.m` (covariance of moments) matrix, which is required for asymptotic SE calculation.
This step has to be done in advance to make the data summary fully exportable, as this step requires the raw data. In larger datasets this step will be the most time-consuming step. However, as with `use_skewness` and `use_kurtosis` described earlier, we highly recommend leaving this enabled to allow for maximum flexibility in `MCMfit()`.
Especially when exporting the data summary to a different research group, it is important that this is enabled. As without it, the other group will have no option to genrate standard errors (as bootstrapping will require the raw data).

### Using a summary

All MCMSEM functions are primarily designed to work with data summary objects. When a matrix or dataframe is passed to `MCMmodel` or `MCMfit` it is first converted into a data summary object.
It is therefore recommended to always make a data summary first, and using that throughout your MCMSEM code, as this will prevent MCMSEM from having to calculate all co-moment matrices multiple times.
``` 
data <- read.csv("mydata.csv")
mcmsem_summary <- MCMdatasummary(data)
mod <- MCMmodel(mcmsem_summary)
```

### Exporting a summary

An MCMSEM summary can be stored to disk, to either share with others or for later use, by using the `MCMsavesummary()` function:
``` 
data <- read.csv("mydata.csv")
mcmsem_summary <- MCMdatasummary(data)

MCMsavesummary(mcmsem_summary, "my_summary")
```

This will generate an `.mcmdata` file (hdf5 format) to the specified path, containing all the required data in a pre-defined structure (see the `Advanced` section below), which can be loaded later, or shared with others.

> :warning: __WARNING__: Do not store MCM data summary objects via R's built-in functions such as  `save()` or `save.image()`, this will result in a corrupt and unusable `S.m` matrix, therefore not allowing for calculation of standard errors.

Below are some estimated file sizes for full (all limiting options described above enabled) summaries depending on the number of input variables. Note that the extreme scaling is to be expected due to the higher order co-moment matrices, plus their covariances.

### Opening an mcmdata file

A previously stored MCM data summary file can be loaded back into R by specifying the `path` argument of the `MCMdatasummary()`:

``` 
mcmsem_summary <- MCMdatasummary(path="my_summary.mcmdata")
```

## Generate test data

### Simulate data

To allow users to easily test for expected performance and settings, the `MCMSEM` package includes a function to simulate data.
The default is a simple test dataset of two variables with one latent factor (the same as used in the publication).

```
simulated_data <- simulate_data()
```

Note that, since the function is intended to be used for `MCMSEM`, by default `simulate_data()` will return an `MCMdatasummary` object. To obtain the raw data as a dataframe include the argument `asdataframe=TRUE`.

If you want to design your own dataset with more variables, you will need to provide the following:
 - `a`: A matrix of latent factor loadings per factor, per variable (each row represents a variable, each column represents a factor)
 - `b`: A matrix of the causal parameters, with 1.0 on the diagonal (each row represents a variable, each column represents a variable)
 - `shape`: Shapes to use for generating skewness (`0` for no skewness), this is passed to `stats::rgamma`
 - `df`: Shapes to use for generating kurtosis (`0` for no kurtosis), this is passed to `stats::rt`

You can also optionally change the sample size from its default 500000 using `n`.

### Data for this wiki

Throughout this wiki we will continue with the same generated data as was used in the Rationale, i.e.:

```
set.seed(14159)
b <- matrix(c(   1,    .3,   0, .25  ,.25, 
                 .05,   1,   0,  .3,  .25,
                 .35,  .4,   1,  .3,   .2,
                 .15, .05,  .1,   1,  .48,
                 0.2,0.25, 0.25,  0,    1), 5,5,byrow=T)

a <- matrix(c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
              0, 0, 0, 0, 0), ncol=2)

simmdata <- simulate_data(n=25000,a=a,b=b,shape=c(7, 0, 3, 4, 5), df=c(0, 8, 0, 10, 12), asdataframe=T)

simdata.holdout <-  simulate_data(n=10000,a=a,b=b,shape=c(7, 0, 3, 4, 5), df=c(0, 8, 0, 10, 12),asdataframe=T)

data_summary <- MCMdatasummary(simmdata)
holdout_summary <- MCMdatasummary(simdata.holdout)
```

### The mcmdata file

The `.mcmdata` file is a `hdf5` file with the following contents:
 - `m2 [dataset, float]`: The full covariance matrix
 - `m3 [dataset, float]`: The full co-skewness matrix
 - `m4 [dataset, float]`: The full co-kurtosis matrix
 - `meta [group]`: Group that contains an individual dataset per matadata item, designed to make it easy to automatically save and load all metadata items.
 - `SE [group]`: Group containing datasets related to precomputed SE matrix
   - `SE/computed [bool]`: Indicating if `S.m` matrix is precomputed and contained in the file
   - `SE/sm [float]`: A vector containing the lower triangle of the full `S.m` matrix, this is the main reason R's built-in `save` functions cannot be used (see note below)
   - `SE/idx [float]`: R-style (1-based) indices from `S.m` to use (typically will be `1:ncol(S.m)`)
   - `SE/idx_nokurt [float]`: R-style (1-based) indices from `S.m` to use (typically will be `1:ncol(S.m)`) in SE calculation if `use_kurtosis=FALSE`
   - `SE/idx_noskew [float]`: R-style (1-based) indices from `S.m` to use (typically will be `1:ncol(S.m)`) in SE calculation if `use_skewness=FALSE`
   - `SE/idx_nokurt_noskew [float]`: R-style (1-based) indices from `S.m` to use (typically will be `1:ncol(S.m)`) in SE calculation if `use_kurtosis=FALSE` and `use_skewness=FALSE`

### Why hdf5 

Because hdf5...
 - Is flexible and allows us to store different matrices and different data types in an easily accessible, structured format
 - Allows binary (strong the co-moment, and `S.m` matrices as anything else would result in gigantic files)
 - Prevents us from having to store the entire class with methods (as RData would), so loading a file saved in an older version will still allow you to work with new methods (assuming that all required data is in the summary object)
 - Allows for easy and direct access from other software, allowing other users and/or developers to easily work with MCM data summary files, even in different programming languages

### A note on `S.m` and `SE/sm`

With larger models, the full `S.m`  matrix becomes very large, therefore the `S.m` matrix is a `torch_tensor` at all times when running MCMSEM, as `torch` is far more efficient at keeping large matrices in memory compared to R.
This results in R treating the `S.m` object as an `external pointer`. When R's default save methods are called on such an external pointer object, only the pointer, (**not the data**) is stored, thus in our case leading to loss of the `S.m` matrix.
To combat having to transfer the full matrix to R in order to save it to an mcmdata file (which would quicly lead to out of memory errors) we first extract the lower diagonal in `torch`, then convert that vector to an R object, then store that vector in the file.
That is the main reason (along with saving quite a bit of disk space) that only the lower diagonal of the `S.m` matrix is stored, and why R's built-in `save` methods cannot be used.

I have thought about creating `save` S3methods for the `mcmdatasummaryclass`, to allow for R's built-in methods to be used on our data summaries, but I have decided against this for the following reasons:
 1. The behavior and result of our saving method is far too different then that of R, which may well lead to some unexpected issues
 2. Our saving method produces an hdf5 file, not an RData file, which may lead to unexpected behavior
 3. Our mcmdata files cannot be loaded via R's built-in `load()`, while this would be expected when it is saved with `save()`
 4. Other saving methods from packages other than base-R will produce these same (and possibly additional) issues which we cannot anticipate

Therefore, to prevent confusion I decided to only allow storing our data summaries via `MCMsavesummary()`
