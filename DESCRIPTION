Description: This package provides a new approach to causal modeling based on cross-sectional data of non-normally distributed variables.
    This method goes beyond traditional covariance structural equation modeling (SEM) by including multivariate higher order moments (MCM), i.e., co-skewnesses and co-kurtoses, which inform the causal direction of relation between variables.
